# CMPSC 311 Class Activities

## Introduction

Designed for use with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), this
repository contains the in-class materials that you will need in Computer Science 311. 
All of the work that you do in class  will count towards your class participation grade.

## Updates

When the course instructor provides the new material for the in-class activity,
 you can type this command in the main directory for this repository:

```
git remote add download git@github.com:allegheny-computer-science-311-f2019/class_activities.git
```

You should only need to type this command once; typing the command additional
times may yield an error message but will not negatively influence the state of
your repository. Now, you are ready to download the updates provided by the
course instructor by typing:

```
git pull download master
```

This second command can be run whenever the course instructor needs to provide
you with new source code for this assignment. However, please note that, if you
have edited the files that the course instructor updated, running the previous
command may lead to Git merge conflicts. If this happens, you may need to
manually resolve them with the help of the instructor or a teaching assistant.
